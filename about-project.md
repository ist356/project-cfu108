1. it grab data from yahoo finance.
we use api keys like https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/AAPL?period1=1717387200&period2=1733349600&interval=1d&includePrePost=true&events=div%7Csplit%7Cearn&&lang=en-US&region=US

2. for the grab, we have write tests

3. then we use pd to convert the data
